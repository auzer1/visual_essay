					<h2>What is pixel art?</h2>
						<p>All the computer screens are consisting of small square pixels.
							Sometimes it calls as dot, because it looks like a dot. At that time,
							when people make games, they needed to type a data on screen.</p>

				<h2>Past</h2>
					<p>In the initial period, the resolution of the screen was not wide as now, also the software that helps to easily, so they had to one by one. This works continued to 90s, with the development of technologies, by the invented tools, such as digitizer and joysticks, people started to insert colours in one block. Also, number of pixel blocks and colours were very limited at that time. However, this kinds of constraints helped to inspire new ideas, such as dungarees and hat for Mario, and Chun-Li’s bracelets from Street Fighters. Even there are only 320 by 240 resolution with 256 colours (console games), and in 640 by 480 resolution with 16 colours especially in PC games made really beautiful graphics in screen in the nineties. This kind of art graphic started to call as pixel art in game magazine. The low colour pixel game was common things when we were younger.</p>

					<h2>Now</h2>
						<p>
							Voxel is a compound word that includes volume and pixel, such
							represent a value on a regular gird in 3D space. Normally it uses
							with cube which can be packed full in one space. As similar to pixel art,
							in voxel graphic, all the cubes have equal size with the others and may have
							more than one piece of data. Minecraft is a video game that uses
							voxels to store terrain data, however it did not use voxel rendering
							techniques. Instead it uses polygon to display each cubic blocks.

					<h2>Future</h2>
						<p>People believed pixel art would disappear as memories, but somehow came back with the indie games. Actually, current dot graphic does not have past limitation of technology, so the domain of expression became massively wide. Top view action games such like Titan Souls is actually three-dimension object, and it is covered by two dimensions that make a harmony to background. This type of expression gives flat monster looks much scary and fill the screen fully like a solid figure. Also, in Hyper Light Drifter did what 1990s games could not. It used the colour graduation and the light effect, this made an unusual atmosphere. In game Fez, they realized two-dimension space in three-dimension world. By the market’s favorable reviews to these games, now, pixel art became one of the how to express art, and pixel game became one of the genre. In my opinion, even time changes and we use virtual reality machine or full HD games, still they are impossible to substitute the taste of simple and rough from pixel genre may survive to future games.

					<h2>Positive Things</h2>
						<p>because of the excessive highly advanced graphics made easily tired to people’s eyes and this happens to find them to the retro games.
							in pixel games, not only a faithful immediacy, but also rough beauty is able to help to run away from sickness of 3D graphics. For example, if the legendary item such has equal abilities and same name in each different style of games, the item in three dimensioned game needs to be extremely delicate and impressive looks, it can be decorations and letters. This might help people to understand what it is, but requires more times for understanding the uses of an item.

					<h2>Negative Things</h2>
						<p>, there are too many works to do and have to do it as an artisan. Past pixel games were almost same as current animation, people had to draw each pages of effects. This means if they want to draw effect of bomb, they have to draw at least twenty-one frames and it is almost two or three seconds. Also, before three-dimension graphic came out to the world, the development of 2D graphics by pixels were great. Such as round shapes and three-dimensional views in the screen. </p>

					<h2>Nostalgia</h2>
						<p>Actually, the viewpoint of pixel graphic is different between generations. For around mid twenties and thirties, it is usually work for retro 80’s to 90’s games like Sonic the Hedgehog, Legend of Zelda, Rockman, Super Mario, and Prince of Persia. However, even these people trying to find nostalgia from these games, it is difficult to feel what they experienced before, because the sentiment is not only from games, also, it is includes all of memories and atmosphere of when we were young. It is an another reason that current games are really violent than past. </p>

						<h2>Raster vs Vector</h2>
							<p>Raster images is covered with pixels; it is also called as bitmap image. Sometimes use an anti-aliasing for make curve more smooth.
								The opposite side of raster is a vector image. It is form of mathematical statements that place dots, lines and shapes in a given 2D or 3D space.
